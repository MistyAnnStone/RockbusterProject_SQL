# Q: How many joins can we include in one query and still keep track of them all?
## A: ... one more!

This query includes several joins and aggregations to output the countries from which the top five customers are, as well as the total number of customers in each of these countries. 

SELECT A.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	COUNT(top_5_customer) AS top_5_customer

JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id

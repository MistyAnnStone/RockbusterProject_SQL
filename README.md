## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a hypothetical movie rental company which had brick and mortar movie rental locations and is now starting a streaming movie service using their movie licenses. This analysis will help with the launch strategy for this new service.

Inital Key Objectives:
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data
The data sets contain information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments. 

I have created a data dictionary with detailed information as well as links between these data sets, which can be downloaded here: [Rockbuster Data Dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bp9uIAmrS0gkXrJF4P_ve8cgtenX6qzB/view?usp=share_link)

## Tools
I have used PostgreSQL and Tableau, as well as Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, for this analysis and presentation. I have also used DbVisualizer to create an ERD (entity relationship diagram).
